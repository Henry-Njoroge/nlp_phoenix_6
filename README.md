# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning (LSTM + GloVe)

This project uses **deep learning techniques** to classify the **sentiment of tweets** directed at various **tech brands** during the SXSW conference.  
Itâ€™s designed for **data science students**, **NLP enthusiasts**, and **machine learning beginners** who want hands-on experience building and evaluating an end-to-end text classification model using **GloVe embeddings** and an **LSTM neural network**.

The project covers everything from:
- Data cleaning and text preprocessing  
- Tokenization and word embeddings  
- Model training with a Bidirectional LSTM  
- Visualization of results and word clouds for each sentiment category  

Whether youâ€™re learning deep learning for the first time or looking to strengthen your NLP portfolio, this project provides a solid foundation.
