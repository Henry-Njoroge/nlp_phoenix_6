# üê¶ Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Tech Brands

## üß† Overview
In today‚Äôs digital age, social media platforms like **Twitter (X)** have become powerful spaces where consumers freely express their opinions about brands, products, and user experiences.  

For technology giants like **Apple** and **Google**, tweets represent an unfiltered stream of public perception that can influence reputation, marketing strategies, and customer loyalty.  

The goal of this project is to **build an automated system** that analyzes and classifies sentiments expressed in tweets related to Apple and Google products.  
This helps organizations **understand market sentiment trends** and **react strategically** to consumer feedback.

## üìä Data Understanding

The dataset contains **Twitter posts (tweets)** from the **SXSW conference**, each labeled with sentiment information.  
It has the following key columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `tweet_text` | The original tweet content mentioning tech products and SXSW experiences. |
| `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at` | The specific Apple or Google product mentioned. |
| `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product` | The sentiment expressed ‚Äî *positive, negative, or neutral.* |

The dataset captures real-world user experiences and opinions about **Apple** and **Google** products, including excitement, praise, frustration, and feedback shared during the SXSW tech conference.

## ü§ñ Modeling

We developed and evaluated several machine learning and deep learning models to classify tweet sentiments.  
Each model‚Äôs performance was measured using **Accuracy** and **F1-Macro** scores ‚Äî with the **F1-Macro** score chosen as the main metric due to the **imbalanced sentiment classes**.

| Model | Description | Accuracy | F1-Macro Score |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes** | Baseline model for text classification | 0.48 | 0.42 |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Linear model for text classification | 0.58 | 0.50 |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | Ensemble model using decision trees | 0.57 | 0.48 |
| **XGBoost Classifier** | Gradient boosting model | 0.56 | 0.47 |
| **Simple RNN** | Basic recurrent neural network | 0.576 | ‚Äî |
| **LSTM** | Long Short-Term Memory network capturing long-term dependencies | **0.629** | ‚Äî |

Among these, the **LSTM model** achieved the **best performance**, leveraging sequential patterns in text to better understand context and emotion.

## üßæ Summary

This project demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to real-world social media data to:
- Understand brand perception  
- Detect emotional trends  
- Support data-driven marketing and customer strategies  

The **LSTM model** proved most effective for this task, showing the potential of deep learning methods in sentiment analysis applications.
